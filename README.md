# KoffKoffs varius configs

This repo holds stuff that I use on my different machines, it is aimed to be agnostic of any
system-specific setups.

All the configuration here is based on the my setup which currently is Artix Linux running OpenRC
with Hyprland as compositor.

## user-config

All files in here should be placed in the home-directory where the names are prefixed with `.`,
e.g. `config` -> `.config` to be picked up byt tools and such.

Most of the config is based on defaults and is a work in progress.

The scripts in `local/bin` are useful to add in extra controls to the official spotify client, and
control things when locking the computer.

## openrc-confg

TODO: Add openrc config.
